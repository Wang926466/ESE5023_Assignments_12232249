# 1st assignment review - chenyy
Good job for the first assignment! I shall give you "97" for this assignment, including "-3" for occasional obscure remarks especially in Problem 3 and 5 (For example: in Problem 3 "骰子和的情况为骰子数*1-骰子数*6", is this means -5*骰子数?), a well-organized logical flow helps both you and others to understand what you did. Keep going!
# Warning 
If you share your script to others and others just copy it without quoting your name, we cannot distinguish who is the original, we will give you two both "0" on HW, please pay attention to this!!! This time only "0" for this question.
So your final work is "77".
