# 1st assignment review - chenyy
Good job for the first assignment! I shall give you "97" for this assignment, including "-3" for occasional obscure remarks especially in Problem 3 and 5 (For example: in Problem 3 "骰子和的情况为骰子数*1-骰子数*6", is this means -5*骰子数?), a well-organized logical flow helps both you and others to understand what you did. Keep going!
