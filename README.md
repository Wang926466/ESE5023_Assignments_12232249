# 1st assignment review - chenyy
Good job for the first assignment! I shall give you "94" for this assignment, including "-1" for occasional obscure remarks especially in Problem 3 and 5, a well-organized logical flow helps both you and others to understand what you did. A "-5" is due to the wrong answer in Problem 3.1. You should know this is quite a good start, keep going!
