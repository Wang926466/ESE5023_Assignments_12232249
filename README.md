## 1st assignment review - chenyy
Good job for the first assignment! I shall give you "97" for this assignment, including "-3" for occasional obscure remarks especially in Problem 3 and 5 (For example: in Problem 3 "骰子和的情况为骰子数*1-骰子数*6", is this means -5*骰子数?), a well-organized logical flow helps both you and others to understand what you did. Keep going!

## 2nd assignment review - chenyy
Good job! You added quite a lot of comments in your script, which is a progress. I shall give you "102" for this assignment, with "2" extra credits. Keep going :).
Here are some suggestions: (1) try to list the hurricane name as the _xaxis_ in Q3.2, using SID seems not intuitive here. 
(2) Try not to show the reports with several warnings, which kind of mess up your report. Please find some useful massage to avoid or turn off the warnings. Hope the link here will be helpful. https://www.dataquest.io/blog/settingwithcopywarning/
